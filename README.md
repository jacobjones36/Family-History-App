# Family-History-App

Created a family history app that allows user to create account, login and and authenticate, create their family tree. The family tree can be displayed in multiple views. From the map one can see where their ancestors life events occurred. Users can use filters to better suit their needs. As well as viewing family members in list formats, upload images, and view the personal profile of the family members.
